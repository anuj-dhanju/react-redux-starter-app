## Feature highlights:

## Getting Started

To get started, please clone this git repository and then run `npm install` once under the project top-level directory. 

This will install the dependencies for the client side.

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node installed on your machine**. (Node >= 6 and npm >= 3 are recommended).

## While You're Developing...
Whenever you want to run/test the program, `cd` to the project top-level directory. Use these commands:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
